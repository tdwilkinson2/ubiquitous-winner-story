There once was a dog named Finnegan. Finnegan was born at a breeder in Wisconsin, and had one
other brother named MacDuff. Together, they played and played, all day long. They lived in a
house with 2 other humans, who played with them. 

One day, Finnegan and MacDuff got into a game of tug of war over a beautiful new bone shaped
chew toy that their 2 human owners had given them. They were busy pulling on the chew toy,
almost ripping that poor toy apart, when they both had an epiphany. They didn't need to fight
so ruthlessly over a chew toy. Their 2 human owners could just buy them a new one. They sat down
with their tails in between their legs in shame. They began an englightening discussion on the
"dog-eat-dog" world that has been created by society's endless greed. 

Few months later, a dog trainer named Bobby bought Finnegan and MacDuff from their former owners.
Everything was change. In order to train them fighting with other dogs, Bobby just bought one
bone and promised it's the only toy during the training time. If Finnegan or MacDuff wanna to own 
the bone exclusive, he has to fight with his brother. Finnegan was more aggressive and he declared
war immediately. He bited MacDuff and the first round ended since MacDuff's left foot was bitten.

But alas, after these initial injuries, they both reached simulateneous enlightement, and realized that 
the world would be a much happier place if they all just got alone. They cared for each other, and nursed 
each other's injuries back to health. Then, they worked together to create a charity to raise awareness 
about the detriments that dogfighting poses to society.
