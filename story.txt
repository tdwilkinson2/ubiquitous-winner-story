There once was a dog named Finnegan. Finnegan was born at a breeder in Wisconsin, and had one
other brother named MacDuff. Together, they played and played, all day long. They lived in a
house with 2 other humans, who played with them. 

One day, Finnegan and MacDuff got into a game of tug of war over a beautiful new bone shaped
chew toy that their 2 human owners had given them. They were busy pulling on the chew toy,
almost ripping that poor toy apart, when they both had an epiphany. They didn't need to fight
so ruthlessly over a chew toy. Their 2 human owners could just buy them a new one. They sat down
with their tails in between their legs in shame. They began an englightening discussion on the
"dog-eat-dog" world that has been created by society's endless greed.
